* Description

  This board controls 1 stepper motor with optional forward and reverse
  limit switches.

* Assembly Instructions

  - Solder header pins into the stepper driver board, making note of TOP label.
    Insert header pins on bottom of board so that the long unsoldered header
    pins point down when the TOP label faces up.
  - Expose one side of the thermal adhesive tape and attach to the bottom of the
    heatsink. Trim tape so it does not extend beyond heatsink edges.
  - Expose the other side of the thermal adhesive tape and attach the heatsink
    to the stepper driver board on the side with the TOP label.
  - Solder surface mount and through hole components onto the pcb.
  - Insert stepper driver board into pin receptacles.
